# Introduction 
Cell Division is a strategy-based board game with a biology/chemisty inspired theme.  Select any *open* position to insert your cell.  Cells divide into more cells whenever a connection of the same color is made (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal connections are allowed). Your score is equal to the total number of cells with your color. The game ends once the board is full.  The player with the highest score at the end of the game score wins!


# How to Play
Players take turns placing their cells in an *open* position.  

You can define who moves first by specifying the **First Move** parameter. 

## Rules
horizontal, vertical, and diagonal

## Gravity


## Scoring

Your score at any moment in the game is equal to the total number of cells with your color. 

As a visual aid, the opacity of a cell increases with the number of divisions.  

*Note that on boards with an odd number of cells, the player that goes first has an advantage.*
